# üç∑ Wine-Quality-Prediction-KNN

A Machine Learning project implementing a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor** model to predict the quality score of red wine based on 11 physico-chemical input features.

---

## ‚ú® ML Details

* **Regression Modeling:** Utilizes `KNeighborsRegressor` to predict a continuous quality score.
* **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Data loading with a semicolon (`;`) delimiter.
    * Feature scaling using **StandardScaler** for optimal distance-based algorithm performance.
    * Standard `train_test_split` procedure.
* **Evaluation:** Model performance is assessed using standard regression metrics.
